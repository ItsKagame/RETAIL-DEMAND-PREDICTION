## Introduction
Demand forecasting in retail is crucial for optimizing inventory management, reducing costs, and enhancing customer satisfaction. Traditional statistical methods have been supplemented by machine learning algorithms, allowing for more accurate predictions based on past sales data, market trends, and more. This project focuses on predicting product demand for an e-commerce tech-gadget retailer.

## Motivation
Retailers face challenges in balancing inventory levels with fluctuating customer demands. This project aims to address these challenges by developing a machine learning-based demand prediction model that adapts to changing market conditions.

## Project Objectives
- **General Objective**: To estimate product demand using machine learning techniques and historical sales data.
- **Specific Objectives**:
  1. Develop a predictive model for forecasting product sales.
  2. Identify key features that affect product sales volumes.
  3. Evaluate the model's accuracy and reliability.
  4. Create an interactive web application for future sales forecasts.

## Methodology
The project employs the Random Forest algorithm and time series methods like SARIMA. Data was preprocessed, and features were engineered to improve the model's performance. Hyperparameter tuning was conducted using grid search, and model validation was performed on unseen data.

## Results
The model was found to have an R-squared of 0.6755, this suggests that the model provides a reasonably good fit to the data. It indicates that a substantial portion of the variability in the target variable is captured by the features included in the model. 

## Key Findings
- **Model Performance**: The Random Forest model provided reliable demand forecasts.
- **Feature Importance**: Key features influencing demand were identified.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimized hyperparameters significantly improved the model's accuracy.

## Recommendations
- Integrate the model into existing decision-support systems for real-time forecasting.
- Focus on key drivers of demand as identified in the feature importance analysis.

## Limitations and Future Work
While the project yielded promising results, there were limitations to consider:
- Data Availability: The quality and quantity of data used to train and validate the model can impact its performance. Future research might benefit from incorporating larger datasets or exploring additional data sources.
- Model Generalizability: The model's performance might vary depending on the specific context and timeframes. Further testing on different data splits or across different regions or time periods is recommended.
- Alternative Models: Exploring other machine learning models or feature engineering techniques could potentially lead to improved forecasting accuracy
